## About Conway's Game of Life 📚

The Game of Life is played on an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead 💀🌱. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

- 🐣 **Birth**: A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
- ☠️ **Death by Isolation**: A live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies.
- 📈 **Death by Overcrowding**: A live cell with more than three live neighbors dies.
- 🌿 **Survival**: A live cell with two or three live neighbors continues to live.

The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed—births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick ⏲️.
